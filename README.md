# Coffee Shop Website

This project is a simple and visually appealing website for a fictional coffee shop, built using HTML and CSS. It leverages Bootstrap 5 for responsive design and layout.

## Features

### HTML:

- **Semantic HTML5:**  Uses elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<footer>` for better structure and SEO.
- **Bootstrap 5 Grid System:**  Employs Bootstrap's grid system (e.g., `row`, `col-md-4`) for flexible and responsive page layout.
- **Navigation Bar:**  Implements a responsive navbar using Bootstrap's navbar component.
- **Forms:**  Includes a basic contact form for table bookings.
- **External Resources:**  Links external CSS (Bootstrap, Font Awesome, custom styles) and JavaScript (Bootstrap) files.

### CSS:

- **External Stylesheet:**  Uses `style.css` for all custom styles, keeping HTML clean.
- **Responsive Design:**  Ensures the website looks good on various screen sizes using Bootstrap's grid system and media queries.
- **Custom Fonts:**  Imports Google Fonts (`Bree Serif`, etc.) for a visually appealing typography.
- **Background Images:**  Sets background images for the banner and other sections.
- **Hover Effects:**  Adds subtle hover effects to buttons and navigation links.
- **Card Layout:**  Uses Bootstrap's card component to showcase products in an organized manner.
- **Text Styling:**  Styles text with different colors, sizes, and weights for readability and hierarchy.
- **CSS Animations:**  Implements a simple slide-in animation for the banner heading and subheadings.
